Consisting of members Sean O'Keeffe, Simon Colebrooke and producer Rob Playford (owner of Moving Shadow records), 2 Bad Mice were a staple on the early-to mid '90s hardcore scene and were instrumental in the music's steady mutation into jungle/drum'n'bass. The group's influential approach to sampled beats -- cutting them up into shards of rhythm and rearranging them in novel combinations (first appearing in mature form on the 1992 hit \"Bombscare\") is generally considered the blueprint from which jungle's characteristic manipulation of breaks was assembled. \r\n\r\nAlthough 2 Bad Mice for the most part stopped producing as the hardcore scene began to wane (Playford focusing his energy on Moving Shadow, now one of the most influential jungle labels), a best-of compilation of the group's work appeared on the American Sm:)e Communications label in 1995. These days Playford continues to work in production, while O'Keeffe, Colebrooke (and Paul Rhodes) currently DJ worldwide as 2 Bad Mice. ",

Later that year, he formed the sublabel [l=Relief Records], mostly for instrumental tracks by himself and others. \r\n\r\nBesides releases from [a=DJ Sneak], [a=Gemini], and [a=Paul Johnson], Green Velvet figured on many of the early Relief singles, including its first, \"Preacher Man\" as well as \"Flash\" (also released on the British label [l=Open]), \"The Stalker\", and \"Answering Machine\" (1997). \r\n\r\nHe began to supplement his Green Velvet DJ-ing schedule with quasi-live gigs as well, and released his first album in 1999. His self-titled release on label [l=F-111 Records] a year later compiled a dozen of his earlier club hits, and the proper sophomore production album \"Whatever\" (2001) appeared on his own Relief label. \r\n",

From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of the Van Halens (guitar and drums, respectively); vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist/vocalist Michael Anthony. In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four  albums over the course of 11 years. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar in 1996, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006 Roth returned, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, Wolfgang Van Halen. In 2012, the band released their final studio album. It was also Van Halen's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang. \r\n\r\n[a211671] died on the 6th October 2020 at St. Johns Hospital, Santa Monica, California after a long battle with throat cancer.",

            "perfil": "Roxy Music were an English rock band formed in 1970 by [a87721], who became the band's lead vocalist and chief songwriter, and bassist [a439088]. Alongside Ferry, the other longtime members were [a10351] (guitar), [a267770] (saxophone and oboe) and [a261914] (drums and percussion), and other former members include [a634] (synthesizer and \"treatments\"), [a262493] (synthesiser and violin), and [a355635] (bass). Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and toured together intermittently between that time and their break-up in 2011. Ferry frequently enlisted members of Roxy Music as session musicians for his solo releases.\r\n\r\nInducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2019 (Performers) and Roxy Music frontman [a87721] was awarded a CBE by Her Majesty the Queen of England on 30 November 2011.\r\n\r\nDiscogs records that Roxy Music have released 28 albums and 38 compilations since the band’s inception back in 1971. Of these, 18 have made the ‘UK Top 40’ music charts with 11 of them reaching the ‘Top 10’ and 4 albums reaching the No.1 position. The albums to hit the top spot are ‘[m=58357]’ (Dec 1973), ‘[m=41847]’ (May 1980), ‘[m=58313]’ (Jun 1982) and ‘[m58362]’ (Apr 1986). These four albums cumulatively spent 13 weeks at the No.1 position. All 18 charting albums, have in total, been in the chart’s Top 10 for 76 weeks and within the Top 40 for 260 weeks.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Roxy Music have had success with some of their 49 single/EP releases. In this case, there has been a chart entry for 18 of these releases, with one single making the No.1 spot. In February 1981, Roxy Music hit the singles chart 'top spot' with the John Lennon composed song ‘[m=58331]’ and spent 2 weeks at that coveted position, 9 weeks in the chart’s Top 40 (6 weeks in the Top 10) and 11 weeks overall.\r\n\r\nThe 18 Roxy Music hit singles/EPs have spent time in the UK Top 40 music charts for 128 weeks, with 44 of these within the Top 10. The single with the most time in the UK Charts is ‘[m=58323]’, which entered the charts in April 1979 and overall spent 14 weeks charting.\r\n\r\nRoxy Music’s first album to enter the UK Charts was the self-entitled ‘[m=58135]’ (Island ILPS9200) making its debut on 29/07/1972.  It stayed in the charts for 16 weeks with its highest position being no.10. The album briefly reappeared in February 2018 under the HDCD release (Virgin ROXYCD1) for one week reaching no.47. The first single to chart for Roxy Music was ‘[m=58141]’ (Island WIP6144) on 19/08/1972 and it remained in the UK charts for 12 weeks achieving a high position of no.4 in its fifth week on the charts.

            "perfil": "Swedish progressive metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1990. Though the group has been through several personnel changes, singer, guitarist, and songwriter [a=Mikael Åkerfeldt] has remained Opeth's driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into their usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from black metal and death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of [i]Blackwater Park[/i], they have led several world tours.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, they published [i]Heritage[/i]. It represents a drastic change in style from their previous albums, adopting a mostly progressive rock sound and only clean singing. Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: \"I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.\" (Metal Hammer)\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 2014, Opeth released its eleventh studio album, titled [i]Pale Communion[/i]. Fredrik Åkesson, spoke about the new direction the band was taking: \"It would be interesting to do a really heavy album, but in a different way. Not to go back, we're not about that. I'm still very proud with the last two albums, I think it's interesting to listen to them, even if I listen in an objective way.\" (Ultimate Guitar)\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Opeth founded their own label, [l1067696] and published the twelfth studio album \"Sorceress.\"",

            "perfil": "Indie rock/pop band with art school roots from London, England.\r\n\r\nBlur formed in 1989 as [a=Seymour] in Colchester, composed of [a=Damon Albarn], [a=Graham Coxon] (1989-2002, 2008- ), [a=Alex James (2)], and [a=Dave Rowntree].\r\nBlur's early releases (the singles \"There's No Other Way\", \"Bang\", \"She's So High\", \"I Know\", and the album \"Leisure\") were considered indie or alternative rock, heavily influenced by the danceable rhythms of \"baggy\" bands like The Stone Roses and noisepop bands like [a=My Bloody Valentine], with strains of weirder ideas running throughout, like Syd Barrett (this was often more readily apparent on several single B-sides, where the group let loose its more atavistic, dark side). By 1992, the group was keen on reinventing themselves with a newer, smarter sound and sense of purpose, eschewing the sounds that were coming out of the U.S. specifically, and returning to a retro spectrum of British rock and pop music: British Invasion groups, Mod groups, Psychedelic Rock, even nostalgic music from World War II. They released their second album, \"Modern Life Is Rubbish\", in 1993, to moderate success and began attracting attention for their stubborn determination to lead Britain out of the miasma that was the grunge years.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the qualified success of \"Modern Life Is Rubbish\" and its accompanying singles, and aided by groups like [a=Suede], Blur rolled out the carpet for the Britpop cultural movement that would all but engulf the UK for two years, releasing in 1994 what was essentially seen by the general public as the Britpop flagship album, \"Parklife\". Everything changed culturally, and Blur was riding the crest of that cultural wave. Following rapidly on the heels of the tipping point that was \"Parklife\", the group's 1995 album \"The Great Escape\" was a vividly nervy and somewhat cartoonish version of the same formula. It left the group with a hangover that it determined it could only cure by taking several steps back from the Britpop sound and culture. The group re-embraced America, digging into influences like Pavement, Dinosaur Jr., The Pixies.\r\n\r\nBy the time Blur's fifth studio album, \"Blur\", came out in 1997, the group had all but severed ties from Britpop and were returning to the same noisy, art rock experimentalism that was a hallmark of their pre-Blur early days in the late 1980s as a indie artrock group [a=Seymour], only this time the music informed by a broader range of influences. Subsequent albums \"13\" and \"Think Tank\" further increased the group's distance from Britpop, eventually encompassing a great diversity of sounds and influences from all over the globe. On February 19, 2015, Blur made a surprise announcement that they'd finished a new album, \"The Magic Whip\", to be made available to the public on April 25, 2015, and also released a new song, \"Go Out\".\r\n\r\nNoteworthy live & session members:\r\n[a=Wayne Hernandez]: lead vocalist with backing choirs since 1997\r\n[a=Simon Tong]: guitarist; replaced Coxon for 2003–04 tour\r\n\r\nWhen marked as a copyright holder, use [l832168].",

His early recordings capture a musician in the relatively conventional confines of bebop and hardbop, but his enduring legacy primarily rests on the modal jazz pioneered by his classic quartet (1960-64) and by free jazz explorations late in his career.\r\n\r\nHe recorded more than fifty albums as a leader and appeared as a sideman on many other albums, performing with other giants of jazz like [a=Miles Davis] and [a=Thelonious Monk]. Coltrane received numerous awards including a posthumous \"Special Citation\" from the Pulitzer Prize Board in 2007 for his 'masterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz'.\r\n\r\nAs his life progressed, his music and outlook became increasingly spiritual. After his death he was proclaimed as a saint by the African Orthodox church that took his name.\r\n\r\nColtrane's second wife was pianist [a=Alice Coltrane]; their son [a=Ravi Coltrane] is also a saxophonist.",

The original lineup of Blakey, Silver, [a=Hank Mobley], & [a=Kenny Dorham], was relatively shortlived.

Although Lateef's main instruments were the tenor saxophone and flute, he also played oboe and bassoon, both rare in jazz, and also used a number of non-western instruments such as the bamboo flute, shanai, shofar, xun, arghul and koto. \r\n\r\nLateef had an inquisitive spirit and was never just a bop or hard bop soloist. He did not care much for the term \"jazz\", consistently creating music that stretched (and even broken through) boundaries. A superior tenor saxophonist with a soulful sound and impressive technique, by the 1950s Lateef was one of the top flutists around. He also developed into a talented jazz soloist on the oboe, was an occasional bassoonist, and introduced such instruments as the arghul (a double clarinet that resembles a bassoon), shanai (a type of oboe), and different types of flutes. \r\n\r\nLateef played \"world music\" long before the term was coined. \r\n",

Something of a musical child prodigy, he grew up in Beaumont, Texas, on a diet of blues and rock 'n' roll. As a teen, nearly every weekend he would hitch-hike to Louisiana to play in small night clubs. After a short college stint, he gave up his academic pursuits and devoted himself to creating music.\r\nHe signed a five year contract with Columbia Records in 1969 (for $300,000) and the rest is history. Before signing to Columbia he recorded one album (two if you consider 'First Winter' als a proper album) and lots of singles, under his own name or as sideman. These have been repackaged and compiled at infinite.\r\n\r\nOlder brother of [a=Edgar Winter].\r\n",

            "perfil": "American blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter (September 16, 1925 near Itta Bena, Mississippi - May 14, 2015, Las Vegas, Nevada). \r\nB.B. is an abbreviation for 'Blues Boy'.\r\n\r\nKing is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname \"The King of the Blues.\" He is considered one of the \"Three Kings of the Blues Guitar\" (along with [a=Albert King] and [a=Freddie King], none of whom are related). Since he started recording in the 1940s, he released over fifty albums. He previously worked as a tractor driver.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, he played on street corners for dimes, and would sometimes play in as many as four towns a night. In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis, TN, to pursue his music career. In Memphis, B.B. stayed with his cousin [a=Bukka White], one of the most celebrated blues performers of his time, who B.B. credits as one of his earliest mentors and teachers. King's first big break came in 1948 when he performed on [a=Sonny Boy Williamson]’s radio program on KWEM out of West Memphis. This radio performance led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King's radio spot become so popular, it was expanded and became the “Sepia Swing Club.” As King worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, he was given the catchy radio nickname \"Beale Street Blues Boy\", later shortened to \"Blues Boy\", and finally to \"B.B.\" \r\n\r\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene on Beale Street. \"Beale Street was where it all started for me\", King said. He performed with [a=Bobby Bland], [a=Johnny Ace], and [a=Earl Forest] in a group known as [a=The Beale Streeters]. In 1949, King made his recording debut on [l=Bullet (2)] ([l=Bullet Recording & Transcription Co.]) by issuing the single [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/7031392-BB-King-Miss-Martha-King-When-Your-Baby-Packs-Up-And-Goes]\"Miss Martha King\"[/url], which did not chart well. Later that year, he began a recording contract with Los Angeles-based [l=RPM Records (5)]. Many of King's early recordings were produced by [a=Sam Phillips (2)] (who later founded [l=Sun Record Company]). King's recording contract was followed by tours across the US, with performances in big city theatres as well as gigs in small clubs and juke joints in the southern United States. During one show in Twist, Arkansas, a fight broke out between two men and caused a fire. King evacuated with the rest of the crowd, but realizing he left his acoustic guitar inside, rushed back inside the burning building to retrieve it. He later discovered the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. Ever since, each one of B.B.’s trademark Gibson guitars has been called Lucille, as a reminder not to fight over women or run into any more burning buildings. \r\n\r\nIn 1952, B.B. had a number one hit with “Three O’Clock Blues,” and began touring nationally soon after. 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label, [l=Blues Boys Kingdom], with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. In 1962, King signed to [l=ABC-Paramount] Records, which was later absorbed into [l=MCA Records]. In November 1964, King recorded the [m=107099] album, considered to be one of his finest recordings. In 1968, B.B. played at the [l=Newport Folk Festival] and at [a=Bill Graham (2)]’s [l=Fillmore West] on bills with the hottest contemporary rock artists of the day who idolized B.B. and helped to introduce him to a young white audience. In 1969, B.B. was chosen by [a=The Rolling Stones] as the opening act for their American tour. He won a 1970 Grammy Award for his version of the song \"The Thrill Is Gone\", which was a hit on both the Pop and R&B charts. It also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. From the 1980s until his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing as much as 300 nights a year.\r\n\r\nB.B. was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).",

His place of birth was, in fact, in Issaquena County near Rolling Fork, Mississippi. However, his gravestone remains dated as 1915.\r\n\r\nMorganfield was inducted into the 'Rock And Roll Hall of Fame' in 1987 (Performer).",

His tutelage on the Mississippi Delta included guitar and showmanship from [a=Charley Patton] and harmonica teachings from [a=Sonny Boy Williamson (2)]. By the end of the 1930's he was a fixture on the Southern Club scene. He was inducted into the U.S. Army on April 9, 1941 and discharged on November 3, 1943. He then moved near West Memphis, Arkansas. In 1948 he formed a band which included guitarists [a=Willie Johnson (4)] & [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/348055-Matt-Murphy]Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy[/url], harmonica player [a=Little Junior Parker], and drummer [a=Willie Steele (2)]. In 1951, [a=Sam Phillips (2)] recorded several songs by Howlin' Wolf at his [l=Memphis Recording Service], and he became a local celebrity. After [a=Leonard Chess] secured his contract, The Wolf relocated to Chicago in 1952. It was in Chicago that his legendary status was secured. Playing with prominent blues musicians such as [a=Willie Dixon],  [a=Jimmy Rogers] and his longtime guitarist [a=Hubert Sumlin], his everchanging lineups remained stellar thanks in part to Burnetts' admirable policies of paying his musicians well and on time, even including unemployment insurance and Social Security contributions, basically unheard of among his peers. Over the years many of his songs have been interpreted by rock bands, including  \"Little Red Rooster\", \"Back Door Man\", \"Killing Floor\", & \"Spoonful\".  [a=Howlin Wolf], with his Memphis and Chicago recordings, his status and influence, surely is one of the vital links between Blues and Rock.\r\n\r\nInducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 (Early Influence).\r\n\r\nBorn June 10, 1910 West Point, Mississippi, USA.\r\nDied January 10, 1976 Hines, Illinois, USA.",

            "perfil": "American blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter (September 16, 1925 near Itta Bena, Mississippi - May 14, 2015, Las Vegas, Nevada). \r\nB.B. is an abbreviation for 'Blues Boy'.\r\n\r\nKing is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname \"The King of the Blues.\" He is considered one of the \"Three Kings of the Blues Guitar\" (along with [a=Albert King] and [a=Freddie King], none of whom are related). Since he started recording in the 1940s, he released over fifty albums. He previously worked as a tractor driver.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, he played on street corners for dimes, and would sometimes play in as many as four towns a night. In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis, TN, to pursue his music career. In Memphis, B.B. stayed with his cousin [a=Bukka White], one of the most celebrated blues performers of his time, who B.B. credits as one of his earliest mentors and teachers. King's first big break came in 1948 when he performed on [a=Sonny Boy Williamson]’s radio program on KWEM out of West Memphis. This radio performance led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King's radio spot become so popular, it was expanded and became the “Sepia Swing Club.” As King worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, he was given the catchy radio nickname \"Beale Street Blues Boy\", later shortened to \"Blues Boy\", and finally to \"B.B.\" \r\n\r\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene on Beale Street. \"Beale Street was where it all started for me\", King said. He performed with [a=Bobby Bland], [a=Johnny Ace], and [a=Earl Forest] in a group known as [a=The Beale Streeters]. In 1949, King made his recording debut on [l=Bullet (2)] ([l=Bullet Recording & Transcription Co.]) by issuing the single [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/7031392-BB-King-Miss-Martha-King-When-Your-Baby-Packs-Up-And-Goes]\"Miss Martha King\"[/url], which did not chart well. Later that year, he began a recording contract with Los Angeles-based [l=RPM Records (5)]. Many of King's early recordings were produced by [a=Sam Phillips (2)] (who later founded [l=Sun Record Company]). King's recording contract was followed by tours across the US, with performances in big city theatres as well as gigs in small clubs and juke joints in the southern United States. During one show in Twist, Arkansas, a fight broke out between two men and caused a fire. King evacuated with the rest of the crowd, but realizing he left his acoustic guitar inside, rushed back inside the burning building to retrieve it. He later discovered the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. Ever since, each one of B.B.’s trademark Gibson guitars has been called Lucille, as a reminder not to fight over women or run into any more burning buildings. \r\n\r\nIn 1952, B.B. had a number one hit with “Three O’Clock Blues,” and began touring nationally soon after. 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label, [l=Blues Boys Kingdom], with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. In 1962, King signed to [l=ABC-Paramount] Records, which was later absorbed into [l=MCA Records]. In November 1964, King recorded the [m=107099] album, considered to be one of his finest recordings. In 1968, B.B. played at the [l=Newport Folk Festival] and at [a=Bill Graham (2)]’s [l=Fillmore West] on bills with the hottest contemporary rock artists of the day who idolized B.B. and helped to introduce him to a young white audience. In 1969, B.B. was chosen by [a=The Rolling Stones] as the opening act for their American tour. He won a 1970 Grammy Award for his version of the song \"The Thrill Is Gone\", which was a hit on both the Pop and R&B charts. It also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. From the 1980s until his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing as much as 300 nights a year.\r\n\r\nB.B. was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).",

They were born on the Isle of Man to English parents, lived in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England, UK and during their childhood years moved to Brisbane, Australia, where they began their musical careers. Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144].\r\n\r\nThe multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.\r\n\r\nNo matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.\r\n\r\nIn 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).\r\n\r\nThey were all given CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.\r\n\r\nHowever, as time passed, they decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner until brother Robin Gibb died in May 2012.",

Though often referred to as \"The Carpenters,\" their name on official releases and press materials was \"Carpenters.\" During a period in the 1970's when louder and wilder rock was in great demand, Richard and Karen produced a distinctively soft musical style that made them among the best-selling music artists of all time.\r\n\r\nOriginally from New Haven, Connecticut, their parents decided to move the family west to Los Angeles, California. Richard and Karen originally played jazz, with Karen having an interest in playing the drums. They were briefly known as Spectrum and then Carpenters, where they then recorded for a small label, [l=Magic Lamp Records]. In their move West, they met Lou Adler who introduced them to [a=Herb Alpert], who signed them to his label, [l=A&M Records] in 1969.\r\n\r\nWhile Richard penned compositions with writing partner, [a=John Bettis], many of the duos' hits were written by others and some were cover versions of established hits for other artists, such as [a=The Beatles] and Motown's, [a=The Marvelettes]. Their 1973 album, \"Now and Then.\" B-side consists of a 9-song medley of 60's hits recorded like a radio show.\r\n\r\nCarpenters' melodic pop, produced a record-breaking run of hits on the American Top 40 and Adult Contemporary charts, and they became leading sellers in the soft rock, easy listening and adult contemporary genres. Carpenters had three #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and fifteen #1 hits on the Adult Contemporary Chart. In addition, they had twelve top 10 singles (including their #1 hits). To date, Carpenters' album and single sales total more than 100 million units.\r\n\r\nDuring their 14-year career, Carpenters recorded 11 albums, five of which contained top 10 singles (\"[m=84990],\" \"[m=84975],\" \"[m=84966],\" \"[m=85055]\" and \"[m=85013],\") thirty-one singles, five television specials, and one short-lived television series. They toured the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, The Netherlands and Belgium. Their recording career ended with Karen's death in 1983 from cardiac arrest due to complications of anorexia nervosa. Extensive news coverage of the circumstances surrounding her death increased public awareness of the consequences of eating disorders. ",

            "perfil": "A singing trio of brothers — [a151481], [a179142], and [a290019]. They were born on the Isle of Man to English parents, lived in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England, UK and during their childhood years moved to Brisbane, Australia, where they began their musical careers. Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144].\r\n\r\nThe multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s.\r\n\r\nNo matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing.\r\n\r\nIn 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).\r\n\r\nThey were all given CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.\r\n\r\nHowever, as time passed, they decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner until brother Robin Gibb died in May 2012.",
